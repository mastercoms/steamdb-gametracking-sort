# steamdb-gametracking-sort

Sort SteamDB GameTracking VPK list by size

(for example: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-TF2/blob/master/tf/tf2_sound_misc_dir.txt)

`python steamdb_sort.py tf2_sound_misc_dir.txt`

Now `tf2_sound_misc_dir_sorted.txt` is located in the same directory, with files sorted in ascending size order.

You can reverse the sort by using `tac`.
